# School_District_Analysis

## Overview: 
This analysis will assist a school board in making decisions about the budget of a school district. It was previously completed, but needed changes because the 9th grade scores from Thomas High School were dishonest. For this analysis, those scores were changed to NaN (this is used to represent missing values in a dataset) and not taken into consideration. Here, we will look at standardized test scores in math and reading, the previous budget allotment, school sizes, and school types.

## Results:
